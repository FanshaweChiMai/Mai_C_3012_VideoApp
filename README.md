# Mai_C_3012_VideoApp
An amateur attempt to create a video streaming app like Netflix.

Update 1.0 : It's not fun when you're working on the app and the computer decided to be completely dead without any notice.
Update 1.1 : Re-doing all the VueJS and database because... computer was reset back to 0. All files are gone. Life happens.
Update 1.2 : Finally got some to work - Apr 24, 2018
